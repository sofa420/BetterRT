# BetterRT

## Intro
So I don't have much to say about this at the moment. It started out as a collection of GreaseMonkey/TamperMonkey scripts that worked half the time. I compiled them into a Chrome extension and fixed the bugs. Hope it works for you guys. If you have the ability to add to it, please do. There's no coding guidelines. If I don't like you're code, I'll just redo it to my liking so feel free to send any pull request. That's all for now, enjoy.

## Features
- Lets you resume videos if you leave and come back.
- Adds skip forward/backward buttons to the video player.
- Full window button next to the existing full screen button.
- Refresh comments without reloading the page.
- Edit comments without leaving the page. (has some issues at the moment)
- Search bar instead of link, so you can search from any page on the site.
